            <p style="margin-left:40px">
                Well, I have started my Profesional career with Android App development. It was Donut, Eclair, Froy release time.
                Developped and published around 6-7 apps and games with these releases.
                <br><br>
                Then, got a chance to work on Android UI framework, where in, maintained Android OS upgrade tasks from older versions to GingerBread(GB).
                Soon, HoneyComb released.. and followed by Ice Cream Sandwitch. Okay, enough of upgrading OS!
                <br><br>
                Back to Android app development space: Developped a digital content publishing app, featuring- list items, In app purchase & subscription handing,
                downloading of content, content reader, content sharing on social media functionalities. It is again a framework kind of app,
                 from which customization starts for each content publisher.
                <br><br>
                By this time, my Android app development experience covered: 3rd partly library integration(OkHttp, Volley, Picasso etc),
                Ad Network integration(AdMob, InMobi etc) and crash/analytics SDK integration(Flurry etc). Also, got several chance to
                develop some of framework/libraries to ease the development process along the way!
